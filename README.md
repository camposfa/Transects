This repository contains R source files for calculating fruit biomass.

- Transects (Transects.csv)
- Fruit patch visits (AllFPV.csv)
- Phenology (pace_pheno.csv)

Other files:
- R source file (fruit_biomass.R)
- R markdown file used to generate the HTML report (fruit_biomass.Rmd)
- A LaTeX file (fruit_biomass.tex) used to generate a pdf report

The HTML report is visible here: http://www.ucalgary.ca/~facampos/data/fruit/
